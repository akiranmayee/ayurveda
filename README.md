# ayurveda
this project deals with the creation of a ontology for ayurveda basics.
we start with the basic principles of human body as prescribed by Patanjali and Sushrutha.
the human body is considered to be made of the five elements in nature - ether, fire, earth, water and air.
there are three major and five minor type of human body (also called doshas) as per their external attributes and behavior - vata, pitta and kapha.
this ontology gives a brief dataset on the characterisitics that define each of the major doshas.
